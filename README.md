# Deep Learning Image Steganography Project

This repository contains an implementation of deep learning-based image steganography, a technique for hiding secret images within cover images in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye.

## Overview

Image steganography is the practice of concealing a secret image within another seemingly innocent image (the cover image). This project uses deep neural networks to:

1. Encode a secret image into a cover image, producing a steganographic container
2. Decode the secret image from the steganographic container

## Architecture

The system consists of two primary neural networks:

### Encoder Network

- Takes two inputs: a cover image and a secret image
- Processes both through a series of convolutional layers
- Creates a steganographic container that visually resembles the cover image but contains the hidden data

### Decoder Network

- Takes the steganographic container as input
- Features multiple blocks of parallel convolutional layers with 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 kernels
- Reconstructs the original secret image

## Features

- Robust hiding of full-color images within other images
- Resistance to minor image transformations through noise layers
- High visual quality of both container and recovered secret images

## Usage

The main functionality is available in the `Steganography.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which contains:

- Implementation of encoder and decoder networks
- Training procedures
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results

## Requirements

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
